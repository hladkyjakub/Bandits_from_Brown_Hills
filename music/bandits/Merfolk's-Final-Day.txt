Merfolk's Final Day

skolni

High-energy folk song, strong bouncy tavern rhythm, cheerful, easy drinking song structure, male voice, strong chorus, uplifting, happy

[Verse 1]
We climbed the mountain high and clear
Where merfolk thought they had no fear
Our boots came thundering up the rise
With laughter ringing through the skies!
[Chorus]
Hey ho! (Hey!)
The mountain's ours today! (Hey!)
We dance and sing and shout with glee
No merfolk left to disagree!
[Verse 2]
Their waters crashed, their magic tried
But human strength would not subside
We sang our song of pure delight
And crushed their world with brutal might!
[Chorus]
Hey ho! (Hey!)
The mountain's ours today! (Hey!)
We dance and sing and shout with glee
No merfolk left to disagree!
[Verse 3]
Each chamber echoed with our roar
We broke right through from floor to floor
Their silver scales could not defend
Against the fury we would send!
[Chorus]
Hey ho! (Hey!)
The mountain's ours today! (Hey!)
We dance and sing and shout with glee
No merfolk left to disagree!
[Verse 4]
We climbed their halls with wild delight
No mercy shown from day to night
Their sanctuary became our prize
With human triumph in our eyes!
[Chorus]
Hey ho! (Hey!)
The mountain's ours today! (Hey!)
We dance and sing and shout with glee
No merfolk left to disagree!
[Verse 5]
Now let us drink and let us sing
Of mountain's fall and what we'll bring
Our human spirit conquers all
No mercy given, standing tall!
[Chorus]
Hey ho! (Hey!)
The mountain's ours today! (Hey!)
We dance and sing and shout with glee
No merfolk left to disagree!
